        <p>
          Two years ago, a small but ambitious team set out to prove that world-class AI technology
          doesn’t have to come from billion-dollar labs — it can come from people who understand what
          real businesses need.
        </p>
        <p>
          Built by an experienced AI engineer and a sales professional from top-tier companies, our journey
          began with a simple goal: to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI and the daily operations of
          modern sales teams. We saw how much potential was being lost in manual outreach, cold calls, and
          disconnected CRM systems — and decided to change that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, our company stands as a growing mid-size business that blends advanced technology with
          human-centric thinking. Over the past two years, we’ve built and refined AI systems that don’t
          just automate — they understand, learn, and sell. Our flagship platform, Dealvox AI, was born
          from that vision: an AI-powered sales voice assistant that runs on top leading large language
          models and connects seamlessly with the world’s most powerful AI service backends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dealvox AI represents the culmination of everything we believe in — practical intelligence,
          scalable innovation, and the relentless pursuit of simpler, smarter workflows. What started as
          a small experiment in AI-driven sales transformation has grown into a trusted solution helping
          businesses close more deals, faster, and with less friction.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’re not here to impress with buzzwords. We’re here to make AI work for people — efficiently,
          intelligently, and at scale.
